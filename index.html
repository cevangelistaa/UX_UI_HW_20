                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) is dedicated to the study and preservation of the culture through its’ website accessible resources. While praised for the use of vibrant colors and images, the current website faces issues with visual design, navigation, and text-sections. My goal was to redesign the website for clarity and consistency, while maintaining the vibrant color scheme and spirit that initially drew users to the website. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>As the sole UX designer, I conducted heuristic evaluations and multiple usability tests, restructured the site’s navigation through card sorting, and created a style guide, wireframes and prototype in a 5-week sprint. This projected was completed as part of my UX/UI design course through George Washington University. </p>

                    <h2>01 - Research & Evaluation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The AIATSIS website is heavily research-based, and the goal for users is to successfully locate information to further educate themselves about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Some pages a user can visit to accomplish their goals include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Research for articles and current projects</li>
                        <li>Family History for tracing Aboriginal ancestry and further family information</li>
                        <li>Collection for various artifacts</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I first wanted to examine AIATSIS’s current website, as well as how users currently navigate to accomplish their intended goals. In order to do this, I conducted a heuristic evaluation and usability test by interviewing people within AIATSIS’ target audience. Users were over the age of 21 who had experience with navigating through an academic-based website for research. </p>

                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>5 usability tests were first conducted to observe how users navigate through the current AIATSIS website. Participants were encouraged to think aloud in order to identify any issues, as well as gather options regarding their overall experience.</p>
                    <p>Users were asked to complete 2 tasks during testing:</p>

                <div class="row">

                    <p>An additional test was conducted to further understand the website’s navigation.</p>
                    <p>The user was asked to rank the items on the primary navigation bar from most to least important. This helped me to discover what users find important in a website, which could be useful in ordering items in a primary navigation bar:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Research & About (tied)</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>Additional tasks were added to test the usability of the primary & secondary navigation bars, and the footer. The user was also timed to see how fast they could complete the tasks - this was to test if the user can complete the task in a reasonable amount of time, or if a task takes longer, which could cause additional stress in a user. </p>

                    <h2>02 - Definition & Organization</h2>
                    <p>From the usability tests, I discovered that navigation was a major pain point:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The primary navigation bar at the top of the screen was the first thing users were drawn to.</li>
                        <li>The overwhelming amount of clickable links and items contributed to visual and information overload.</li>
                        <li>Users were frustrated with not being able to find certain information right away, instead of finding it after 1-2 clicks on a webpage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With these findings, I wanted to focus on restructuring the navigation and formatting the layout to be more user-friendly. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
                    <p>In order to restructure the navigation, I first conducted a card sorting exercise to help organize and categorize information. All 47 items in the primary & secondary navigation bar were written out and sorted into groups based on similarity. With this, primary navigation was consolidated from 8 to 6 items, while secondary and tertiary paths were created to further help with organization.</p>

                    <p>Based off card sorting and an updated site map, I designed an updated primary navigation bar to have the logo and six options a user can choose from.</p>

                        <li>The AIATSIS logo</li>

                    </ul>
