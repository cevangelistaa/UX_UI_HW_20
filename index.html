                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) is dedicated to
                    the study and preservation of the culture through its’ website accessible resources. While praised
                    for the use of vibrant colors and images, the current website faces issues with visual design,
                    navigation, and text-sections. My goal was to redesign the website for clarity and consistency,
                    while maintaining the vibrant color scheme and spirit that initially drew users to the website.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>As the sole UX designer, I conducted heuristic evaluations and multiple usability tests, restructured
                    the site’s navigation through card sorting, and created a style guide, wireframes and prototype in a
                    5-week sprint. This projected was completed as part of my UX/UI design course through George
                    Washington University.</p>

            <h2>01 - Research & Evaluation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The AIATSIS website is heavily research-based, and the goal for users is to successfully locate
                information to further educate themselves about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Some
                pages a user can visit to accomplish their goals include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Research for articles and current projects</li>
                <li>Family History for tracing Aboriginal ancestry and further family information</li>
                <li>Collection for various artifacts</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I first wanted to examine AIATSIS’s current website, as well as how users currently navigate to
                accomplish their intended goals. In order to do this, I conducted a heuristic evaluation and usability
                test by interviewing people within AIATSIS’ target audience. Users were over the age of 21 who had
                experience with navigating through an academic-based website for research. </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
                <p>The desktop & mobile versions of the website were examined to pinpoint any usability issues and help
                    with brainstorming potential solutions.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Additionally after using the WAVE tool to identify accessibility issues, it was discovered that
                    certain text portions in the primary navigation bar fail to meet AA guidelines due to color
                    contrast.</p>

                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>5 usability tests were first conducted to observe how users navigate through the current AIATSIS
                    website. Participants were encouraged to think aloud in order to identify any issues, as well as
                    gather options regarding their overall experience.</p>
                <p>Users were asked to complete 2 tasks during testing:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <ol>
                    <li>Access a list of articles within the research publications section of the website</li>
                    <li>Find information about an object (particularly, a boomerang) within the collection section of
                        the website</li>

            </div>
            <div class="row">

                <p>An additional test was conducted to further understand the website’s navigation.</p>
                <p>The user was asked to rank the items on the primary navigation bar from most to least important. This
                    helped me to discover what users find important in a website, which could be useful in ordering
                    items in a primary navigation bar:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Research & About (tied)</li>
                    <li>Collection</li>
                    <li>Explore</li>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>What's New</li>
                    <li>Family History</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Additional tasks were added to test the usability of the primary & secondary navigation bars, and the
                    footer. The user was also timed to see how fast they could complete the tasks - this was to test if
                    the user can complete the task in a reasonable amount of time, or if a task takes longer, which
                    could cause additional stress in a user. </p>

                <h2>02 - Definition & Organization</h2>
                <p>From the usability tests, I discovered that navigation was a major pain point:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The primary navigation bar at the top of the screen was the first thing users were drawn to.
                    </li>
                    <li>The overwhelming amount of clickable links and items contributed to visual and information
                        overload.</li>
                    <li>Users were frustrated with not being able to find certain information right away, instead of
                        finding it after 1-2 clicks on a webpage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With these findings, I wanted to focus on restructuring the navigation and formatting the layout to
                    be more user-friendly. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
                <p>In order to restructure the navigation, I first conducted a card sorting exercise to help organize
                    and categorize information. All 47 items in the primary & secondary navigation bar were written out
                    and sorted into groups based on similarity. With this, primary navigation was consolidated from 8 to
                    6 items, while secondary and tertiary paths were created to further help with organization.</p>

                <h2>03 - Ideation & UI Design</h2>
                <p>Based off card sorting and an updated site map, I designed an updated primary navigation bar to have
                    the logo and six options a user can choose from.</p>

                    the search bar before clicking on it to activate.</p>

                <p>Apart from redesigning the navigation, I wanted to focus on restructuring the layout of AIATSIS
                    homepage to be more user-friendly, but still be aesthetically pleasing. Taking inspiration from
                    other government agency websites, the wireframes went through multiple iterations based on feedback
                    from user testing.</p>

                    <li>One user remembered the layout more than the navigation itself</li>
                    <li>One user wondered why the primary navigation options repeated itself on the main page and
                        thought it felt redundant.</li>

                <h2>The Next Steps</h2>
                <p>For me, it was a challenging few weeks that involved thinking outside the box and relying on numerous
                    resources to get the job done. However, this project helped me practice and shape my UI skills to
                    make functional, but aesthetically pleasing products.</p>
                <p>Initially, I had made the mistake of designing other aspects of the website instead on focusing on
                    designing useful components first. Once they were designed, putting together the remainder of the
                    website was much easier.</p>
                <p>Future opportunities include additional iterations and redesign beyond the homepage and navigation. I
                    would also like to include interactive sections to enhance the user experience.</p>
                <p>Overall, I am proud of what I’ve been able to accomplish in 5 weeks, and look forward to similar
                    projects like this in the future!</p>
